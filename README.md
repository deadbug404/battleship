# Battleship

A classic game of Battleship using javascript and implementing a TDD(Test Driven Development) methodology using JEST. A TDD methodology is a concept where you write the tests first before the actual code. In this way you will be able to make a better quality of code since the idea is to focus on testing the code throughout the process of development.
